                    It's species is bred specifically by the people of the Forest, but has always been considered extinct in the wild.<br>
                    Outsiders don't even know of it's existance.</p>
                <p>Mystie Forest researchers of the Village are given Gekkou to train and once it's fully grown, is proof the researcher is ready to work.
                    The better trained a Gekkou is, is said to mean the specific researcher is naturally gifted.
