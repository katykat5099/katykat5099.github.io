                <h2>Buckleo</h2>
                <p>Buckleo is a spirit that lives within the ruins. It's usually very aggressive, constantly trying to pick
                    a fight with anyone living. It, however, does not fight head on and usually uses strategies that allow
                    it to fight at a distance. Nobody knows why it behaves the way it does, but people speculate that, that
                    is the reason for its extinction.
                </p>
                <p>Researchers have found the similarity between Buckleo and Lauleo to be so similar that they think they could
                    be related, which is why the names of the two are so similar.
