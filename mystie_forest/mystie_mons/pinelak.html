                <h3>Pinelak</h3>
                <p>A common plant-like creature that resides within the forest. It's small and vulerable to the beasts of the forest, but has a strong defence: spikes.<br>
                    It uses it's spikes in self-defence, and causes anything that steps on it, or tries to eat it, to feel a shock and make them flinch.
                </p>
                <p>It creates its nests inside of pine trees. It uses the pine trees to blend in, and use as another wall of defence. It also likes the sap that these trees produce.</p>
