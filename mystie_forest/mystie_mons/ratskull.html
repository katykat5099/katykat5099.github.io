                <h3>Ratskull</h3>
                <p>Small, but evil. This creature is not common, but when it does appear, will most certainly cause some chaos. 
                    It is said that encountering this pesky rat brings a lifetime of extreme bad luck. 
                    For some reason, every Ratskull has a natural instinct to cause chaos and harm to other creatures.
                    It may be best not to cross paths, or even try to befriend such a horrid beast.
                </p>
                <p>There are even tales told in some old text of destruction brough by these creatures, legends that seem so unreal for such a small monster.
                    A mysterious creature, indeed. One a researcher would certainly have a time, though insane, to unravel.
