                <h3>Gekkou</h3>
                <p>A Baby Dragon with loyalty that rivals Man's Best Friend. Has a strong imprinting instinct once a chosen partner is found.
                    It will learn from it's partner, and use what it learns to protect their partner as it grows.
                    This relationship goes back hundreds of years, with each generation only getting wiser and stronger.<br><br>
                    This species is, however, extinct in the wild and the current species is too reliant on humans to survive. However, there is not many recorded attempts at this...
                    This species only breeds every decade, and the offspring take many years to develop to be independent. Very vulnerable during these years. Only a handful of individuals are born. 1 to 2 per pair.
                    So, it is simply not something of choice.
                </p>
                <p>Its stats are well-rounded, as well as it's moveset. Giving a trainer a lot of variety to work with in terms of building.
                    Gekkou has a very good ability to adapt, so you can work with this ability to build a strong character.
